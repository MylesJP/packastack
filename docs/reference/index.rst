=========

This section is the vault of exactitude—the contracts, invariants, and knobs. Read these pages when you need to know precisely how schroots behave, how the local repo is wired, what binds are mounted, what offline means, and how the CLI promises to behave. Craving the guided tour instead? Jump to :doc:`../tutorial/quickstart`. Want recipes, not legalese? See :doc:`../howto/index`.

If a command or switch is not documented here, it is not a contract yet. Future conveniences (schroot/admin helpers, auto-init wizards) will land here only when real.
