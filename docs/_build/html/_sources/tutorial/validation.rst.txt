Validation Steps
================

After your first build, validate that everything is working as intended: tests pass, artifacts are present, and offline mode is honored.

Run Tests
---------

Builds run validation steps automatically. To re-run validation for your package, re-run the build:

.. code-block:: bash

   packastack build nova --series noble --arch amd64

Check Artifacts and Repo
------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

   tree <workspace>/output
   tree <workspace>/localrepo

Offline Check
-------------

Disconnect networking (or disable Wi-Fi) and run:

.. code-block:: bash

   packastack build nova --offline --series noble --arch amd64

If the build succeeds, your environment is fully pre-seeded.

If something fails, consult the how-to guides for debugging and cleanup.
