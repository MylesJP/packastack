Schroot Creation (superseded)
==============================

This legacy tutorial has been superseded by the quickstart. PackaStack now creates and refreshes schroots automatically during builds; there is no ``packastack schroot`` command yet. If you suspect a broken schroot, remove it with your system schroot tools and rerun a build—PackaStack will recreate it. See :doc:`../howto/refresh-schroots` for the current workaround.
