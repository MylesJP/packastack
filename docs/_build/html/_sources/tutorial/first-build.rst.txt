First Successful Build
======================

In this tutorial you will run your first end-to-end PackaStack build, producing packages and publishing them to the local repo.

Build
-----

.. code-block:: bash

   packastack build nova --series noble --arch amd64

What happens:
- PackaStack ensures the schroot exists and is fresh.
- Sources are prepared, dependencies resolved, and packages built inside the schroot.
- Artifacts and logs are copied to the workspace output directory.
- Packages are published to the local repo.

Verify
------

Inspect the local repo and artifacts:

.. code-block:: bash

   tree <workspace>/output
   tree <workspace>/localrepo

Next, run :doc:`validation` to confirm tests and offline guarantees.
