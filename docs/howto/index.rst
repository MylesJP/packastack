How-to Guides
=============

Practical spells for everyday PackaStack life. Each guide tackles a single itch—offline work, schroot refreshes, missing packages, state inspection, cleanup—so you can fix things fast and get back to building. If you want the narrated road trip, start at :doc:`../tutorial/quickstart`. If you crave contractual fine print, wander to :doc:`../reference/index`. Otherwise, grab a guide and go.
